eContext\\Classify
==================

Use the listed classes to classify various structured and unstructured text into actionable data using the eContext API.
Typically, you should pick the classification class which best matches the data you want to submit.  For example, if you
have HTML content pages, you should use :doc:`html/html`.  If you have short-form text like Tweets or 1-2 paragraph
posts, use :doc:`social/social`.  Longer form text should be submitted using :doc:`text/text`.
