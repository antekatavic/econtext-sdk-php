Introduction
============

The eContext API is a best-of-class structured and unstructured text classification tool.  eContext can process
structured and unstructured text and tag to the eContext taxonomy of over 400,000 curated, hierarchical, topics.  This
functionality can be used to identify user segments, organize content, sort content based on user preferences, flag
inappropriate content, etc.

The eContext PHP SDK is intended as a quick-start library to get you up and running with the eContext API in PHP
environments.  This documentation aims to provide an overview of available functionality and explanation of the various
objects available.
